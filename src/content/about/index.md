description: All true information about Ethan Palm
---

I am a writer in California.

Professionally, I work as a technical writer and content strategist. I currently lead docs at [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). Previously, I worked at [GitHub](https://github.com). I'm most interested in back end content strategy and creating systems for smooth content operations. I'm encouraged when people who don't typically consider themselves writers contribute to high quality documentation.

Personally, I write short fiction, long fiction, and essays. Beyond writing, I love games and puzzles; time with my family and friends; and experiences in nature that remind me I'm small but it's okay.

I strongly prefer email to social media. Please feel free to write me and I'll write back.

This is another cool [Ethan Palm](https://ethanpalm.net/).
