description: All true information about Ethan Palm
---

I'm Ethan, a writer in California.

Professionally, I work as a technical writer and content strategist. I currently lead docs at [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com). Previously, I worked at [GitHub](https://github.com). I'm most interested in back end content strategy and creating systems for smooth content operations. I'm encouraged when people who don't typically consider themselves writers contribute to high quality documentation.

All views on this site are my own. All content is based on my personal experience and opinions. No content on this site represents the views or positions of my current or any past employers.

I wrote everything on this site. I do not use AI tools for generating blog posts. (Note: I used Claude Code for help setting up the site.)

Personally, I write short fiction, long fiction, and essays. Beyond writing, I love games and puzzles; time with my family and friends; and experiences in nature that remind me I'm small but it's okay.

I strongly prefer email to social media. Please feel free to write me and I'll write back.

This is another cool [Ethan Palm](https://ethanpalm.net/).
